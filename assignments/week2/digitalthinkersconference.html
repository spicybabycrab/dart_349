        <p><b>DESIGN</b><br>This website is nicely designed because it was made for a design conference. The animated illustrations, transitions, buttons, choice of colour, typography really compliment each other to create an interactive user experience. The splash page utilizes the loading percentage in a red circle in the middle, echoing the Japanese flag as the conference is held in Tokyo. The aesthetics are also just very intricate and appealing.</p>
        <p><b>USABILITY</b><br>Some things in the website are extremely laggy because there are many heavy full-screen animated illustrations. The designers of this website tried really hard with interactive aspects of the design that it takes away from the actual content on some pages.</p>
        <p><b>CREATIVITY</b><br>This website goes far in-depth in creating a heavily visual aesthetic atmosphere where there are many animated components. It is really pleasing to look at, but I feel like all these special effects overpower the text and information that we really need.</p>
        <p><b>CONTENT</b><br>The content is pretty straight forward; it announces the speakers, schedule, workshops, and venues for the conference, and provides a link to buy tickets.</p>
