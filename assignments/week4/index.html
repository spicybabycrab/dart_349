            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p>Foxes are found all over the world, central to the myths and folklores from many different cultures. They are often depicted for their possession of great intelligence, long life, and incredible magical powers. One of their most defining characteristics is their highly mischievous and cunning nature, playing the role of a trickster.</p>
            <p>In African Dogon mythology, the pale fox is the trickster god of the desert, embodying chaos (Allen). In European mythology, the trickster fox was associated with wily fraudulent behaviour, sometimes burned as symbols of the Devil (Benton). In Chinese and Korean folklores, foxes often describe beautiful malevolent women who play tricks on young men (Kang).</p>
            <p>Likewise, the kitsune in Japanese folklore also exhibits trickster traits. Kitsune are the subjects of tales in which they delight themselves in mischief, pranks, and evil. Most stories present them as extremely intelligent and powerful shapeshifters, frequently punishing wicked priests, greedy merchants, and boastful drunkards by creating phantom sounds and sights, stealing from them, or otherwise humiliating them publicly.</p>
            <p>They are skilled enough to transform into the exact likeness of specific individuals, often appearing in the guise of beautiful women to seduce a man away from his wife and dangerously disrupting family or village life (Foster, 7).</p>
            <p>The role of the trickster in folklore tells us a lot about Japanese culture; its issues, problems, hopes and fears of a particular period in time. By exploring origins of the kitsune and some of the stories and myths that are associated, we are able to recognize some of the psychological needs and social frailties in history.</p>

      <h1>Huli Jing</h1>
       <p>
       Kitsune myths had their origins rooted from Chinese mythology, in which tales tell of nine-tailed fox spirits with super-transformative powers called huli jing. In Chinese culture, it is commonly believed through the Setsuwa Bungaku (Buddhist didactic literature) that all things are capable of acquiring human forms, magical powers, and immortality, provided that they receive sufficient energy (Nicolae, 570).

       <p>In one of the most popular 16th-century Chinese novels, Fengshen Yanyi by Lu Xixing and Xu Zhonglin, the last ruler of the Shang dynasty, King Zhou, becomes bewitched by his concubine Daji, a huli jing disguised as a beautiful woman.</p>

            <p>Throughout the story, King Zhou starts to neglect state affairs in order to please Daji, who he became extremely infatuated with. He starts to oppress his people and persecute those who opposed him. He was also invested in Daji’s joy for human torment.</p>
            <p>Paolao, one of Daji’s best known torture methods, for instance, forces victims to walk on top of a slowly heated cylinder covered in oil, placed above a pit of burning charcoal. If the victim fell into the charcoal pit below, they would be burned to death, thus they had to dance and scream in agony before dying while King Zhou and Daji would laugh in delight (Liu).</p>
            <p>Daji was the first featured corrupter of the declining Shang dynasty, if not, the ultimate blame for the fall of the Shang dynasty, by causing King Zhou to rule with tyranny and despotism, and consequently leading widespread chaos throughout the country (Kang).</p>
            <p>The Chinese huli jing mythology demonstrates a classic example of how beauty causes the downfall of a dynasty, but also uses women and their supernatural powers to rationalize the failures of hegemonic male superiority from its time. From Chinese folklores of huli jing, such as Fengshen Yanyi, the motif of the fox as colluding seductresses, came to be adapted and imbued in subsequent Japanese mythology.</p>

        <h1>Zenko</h1>
         <p>There are two common variations of the Japanese kitsune: the zenko and yako. Zenko are benevolent, celestial foxes, serving Inari, the Shinto deity of rice, harvest, and fertility. The farmers in ancient Japan revered foxes, which preyed on the mice which destroy crops. Since mice eat rice, and foxes eat mice, the zenko came to be associated with Inari. Legends tell of zenko providing wisdom or service to good and pious humans. They act as the intermediary messengers between the human world and the celestial world. These foxes often protect humans or places, providing good luck and warding evil spirits away (yokai.com).</p>

         <p>Physically, kitsune are noted for having multiple tails. A greater number of tails indicates an older, wiser, and more powerful fox; in some folktales, the kitsune grows additional tails each hundred years that it has lived (Hamel, 91). With each new tail that a kitsune gains, more abilities are unlocked. The kyubi no kitsune (nine-tailed fox), for example, obtains a coat of white fur, becoming a byakko myobu (white high ranking fox spirit), and gains the ability to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. After reaching one thousand years of age, a kitsune’s fur turns gold, ascending to the heavens as a celestial tenko (divine heavenly fox), the most powerful form of a kitsune.</p>
     </article>
     <article>
         <p>It can be inferred that the benevolent kitsune motif came from the Buddhist religion through the Dakiniten, the female bodhisattva conflated with Inari’s female aspect in which she is always depicted riding a flying white fox (Smyers, 82). Similar to Kannon, the Buddhist Goddess of mercy and compassion, or Amaterasu, the Shinto deity of the sun and universe, Inari provides universal assurance, prosperity and safeguarding in response to the spiritual needs of Japanese people. Consequently, it is important to note that the kitsune becomes revered when it is associated with these compassionate images of divine women, revealing the belief that women are the hearth and protectors of our world.</p>

          <h1>Yako</h1>
           <p>Conversely to the zenko, kitsune that are most often depicted in Japanese folklore are the yako: wild, occasionally wicked foxes, who delight themselves in mischief, pranks, or evil. They are the subjects of stories in which foxes trick, or even possess humans and cause them to behave strangely (yokai.com).</p> 
           <p>For much of Japanese history, from as early as the Heian period until modern 20th century medicine was introduced, mental illness and nervous disorders amongst women were usually blamed on kitsune-tsuki (possession by foxes). Women who behaved erratically, emotionally, or violently had their bodies inhabited by kitsune. Likewise, women who showed signs of jealousy, provocative behaviour, or assertive control over men were also attributed to kitsune-tsuki.</p> 
           <p>For instance, in Otogi Zoshi literature from the Muromachi period (1392-1573), there is one true villainess kitsune named Tamamo-no-Mae. Similar to the huli jing Daji from Chinese mythology, Tamamo-no-Mae was cruel for the sake of being cruel, taking pleasure in causing the death of thousands. She served as Emperor Toba’s court lady and was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman, answering questions that the emperor did not even understand.</p>
           <p>Emperor Toba became enamoured with Tamamo-no-Mae, cherishing her as if she was his empress. Almost immediately after Tamamo-no-Mae became his consort, the emperor fell deathly ill. Tamamo-no-Mae was possessed by a kitsune and was poisoning Emperor Toba through seduction and charm, slowly shortening his life span in order to take his place as ruler of Japan. Her actions destabilized the country and lead it towards one of the most important civil wars that ended the Heian era (yokai.com).</p>
           <p>It is evident through myths, such as Fengshen Yanyi and stories of Tamamo-no-Mae, that the yako trope reflects cultural fears in the dissipation of social order at the hands of a succubus femme fatale. In the article Kitsune, Coyote of the Orient, Watts Martin writes how kitsune in most stories are female: “Women in Japanese culture and many other patriarchies are also often seen with the bane/benefactor duality, the lady to be venerated and protected from manipulation set against the dangerous, manipulative femme fatale” (coyotetracks.org). The representation of women as being both good and evil—the zenko as benefactor and guardian, and the yako as beguiler and trickster—reflects the role of maternal identity in the maintenance of a patriarchal Japan.</p>

        <h1>Today</h1>
         <p>Although they have lost some of their folkloric sexual allure, the portrayal of powerful, playful, transformative kitsune has transcended even to the popular media of modern times. The kitsune appears in many recent Japanese manga, anime and video games such as Kurama from Naruto (1997), Ryutaro and his show girls from Pom Poko (1994), Vulpix and Ninetales from Pokemon (1995), Shippo from Inuyasha (1996), Hagoromo Gitsune from Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan (2007), and Keaton from The Legend of Zelda (1986).</p>

     <article>
         <p>The kitsune from mythology acts as a symbol for social critique, discursively reflecting the role of women throughout Japanese history. From the image of a divine maternal goddess to that of a malevolent vulpine enchantress, the kitsune represents some of our continuous societal fears, attitudes, and decadence that remains in the popular subconsciousness.</p>
